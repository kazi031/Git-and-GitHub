*Suppose we wrote something wrong in the file and then used the git command
>> git add ucl_2012.txt
*by this way we staged the file to unstage it we have to write the command
>> git reset ucl_2012.txt

*What if instead of staging them we committed them then we realise we made a mistake.
 >> git log
 >> git reset HEAD~1 --soft 
** this command gets me to the previous commit and the file is staged for commit.
 >> git reset HEAD~1 --mixed
** this command gets me to the previous commit and the file is unstaged for commit.
 >> git reset HEAD~1 --hard
** completely removes the latest commit and goes back to the previous commit.
