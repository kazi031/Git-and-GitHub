Step 1 > Creating a directory

mkdir shop 

c (to get into the directory)

Step 2 > we wanted to track this directory

git init (initialized empty git repository)

Now we will be albe to track the files or track the changes we make to files in this directory.

if we want to show the files in the repository :

ls(show the files in the directory)

ls -A(will show dir)

cd .git

ls -A

cd ..(move out of the dir)

touch lists.txt
rm lists.txt
touch list.txt

ls
clear

git status
git is still not tracking the file we created(list.txt)
 

Step 3 > The add command tells git to start tracking a particular file

git add list.txt
git status
git commit -m "Create Shopping list"
git status
git log(history so far of commits for this file)
